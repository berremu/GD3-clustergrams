# GD3 Clustergram Scripts

This repository contains R scripts used to generate clustergram heatmaps for key biomolecules (proteins, miRNAs, transcription factors, and ceRNAs) involved in Gaucher Disease Type 3 (GD3). These visualizations were part of the transcriptomic analysis pipeline used in the associated undergraduate thesis project.

## Contents

- `clustergram_proteins.R`: Generates heatmap and dendrogram of key proteins and biomarkers.
- `clustergram_miRNAs.R`: Visualizes regulatory relationships between DEGs and miRNAs.
- `clustergram_ceRNAs.R`: Shows lncRNA/ceRNA clustering.
- `clustergram_TFs.R`: Visualizes transcription factors interacting with GD3 biomarkers.

## Requirements

- R (>= 4.0.0)
- Packages: `pheatmap`, `dplyr`, `readxl`, and `tidyverse`

## Citation

This code was used in support of the thesis titled:
“Transcriptomic-Guided Drug Repositioning in Gaucher Disease Type 3”
